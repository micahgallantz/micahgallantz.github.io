	<h1>MYSTERY DISEASE BREAKS OUT AROUND MONTGOMERY HILLS!!</h1>
<p>This article is brought to you by the Montgomery Hills Post, regarding the grave situation currently inflicting our population. According to the Montgomery Hills Epidemiology Department(MHED), people are currently being plagued by a mysterious illness that is believed to be foodborne. Our team of epidemiologists, through intricate data analysis, has determined that this “mysterious illness” is a neurotoxin that we refer to as “Nerfus”. The cause: Sparky’s Restaurant and their Chicken Sandwich. When analyzing our data, we determined that The chicken sandwich had the highest food specific attack rate of anything consumed in the past few days (since the epidemic started). In addition, chicken is known to be a culprit of harboring bacteria. We have reason to believe that the Sparky’s owner intentionally poisoned the dish, because it is extremely easy to not poison somebody with restaurant food, just cook it properly and check the expiration date. Anyone exposed can expect to experience trouble breathing, dehydration, and increased heart rate, as well as trouble seeing, hearing, and using fine motor skills. However, there is no need to worry, the incubation period of the illness is only 48 hours, so symptoms should clear up rather quickly. Our employees at Montgomery Hills post are determined to make sure that Sparky himself will experience the fiery wrath of justice that he deserves. After all, as our CEO puts it, “those who poison the population will meet a swift and very literal version of the phrase, ‘getting a taste of your own medicine’.
