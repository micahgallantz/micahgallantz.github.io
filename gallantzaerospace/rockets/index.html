<h3>Prometheus Rocket</h3>
<p>The prometheus rocket was developed alongside the blip flight computer to use active thrust vector control to control itself. To learn more about thrust vector control, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thrust_vectoring" target="_blank">Click here</a>. Prometheus is for all extensive purposes, nearly ready for flight, only being delayed by the blip flight computer. Blip takes in data from 2 sensors, and calculates the optimal motor angle to maintain stability. Then, blip sends that data to prometheus, which adjusts two servos the reorient the motor. It flies on an estes F15-0 rocket motor, and rescends on two parachutes. It flies to about 200 meters, and is built of two 3 inch body tube sections. The nose cone, as well as several parts around the rocket are 3d printed on an ender 3 pro 3d printer. <br><b>Status:</b> in development<br><b>In service:</b> n/a<br><b>Motor:</b> Estes F15-0<br><b>Parachutes:</b> two<br><b>Diameter:</b> 76mm<br><b>Length:</b> 1 meter<br></p></div>

<h3>Pegasus I Rocket</h3>
<p>Pegasus was Gallantz Aerospace's first rocket, and its goal was to develop manufacturing and design capability for Gallantz Aerospace. It has flown twice currently, with 2 flights planned before it is retired and replaced with the Pegasus II. It is controlled with 3d printed fins, and reaches and apogee of about 250 meters<br><b>Status:</b> in use<br><b>In service:</b> nov 2020-current <br><b>Motor:</b> Estes D12-7<br><b>Parachutes:</b> 1<br><b>Diameter:</b> 34mm<br><b>Length:</b> 1 meter<br></p></div>

<!--Pegasus II image-->
<h3>Pegasus II Rocket</h3>
<p>Pegasus II is being developed as a replacement to the current Pegasus rocket. It was developed to reach higher speeds and altitudes than Pegasus I. It will reach a maximum altitide of 1000 meters or 1 kilometer. It will have a very basic flight computer to allow it to log flight data and deploy the parachutes, but it will not have any active control capability. <br> <b>Status:</b> in development <br> <b>In service:</b> n/a <br> <b>Motor:</b> unknown<br> <b>Parachutes:</b> unknown<br> <b>Diameter:</b> unknown<br> <b>Length:</b> unknown <br> </p> </div>
