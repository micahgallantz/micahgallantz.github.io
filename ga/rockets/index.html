<h3>Prometheus Rocket</h3>
<p>The prometheus rocket was developed alongside the blip flight computer to use active thrust vector control to control itself. To learn more about thrust vector control, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thrust_vectoring">Click here</a>. Prometheus is for all extensive purposes, nearly ready for flight, only being delayedd by the blip flight computer. Blip takes in data from 2 sensors, and calculates the optimal motor angle to maintain stability. Then, blip sends that data to prometheus, which adjusts to servos the reorient the motor. It flies on an estes F15-0 rocket motor, and rescends on two parachutes. It flies to about 200 meters, and is built of two 3 inch body tube sections. The nose cone, as well as several parts around the rocket are 3d printed on an ender 3 3d printer. <br><b>Status:</b> in development<br><b>In service:</b> n/a<br><b>Motor:</b> Estes F15-0<br><b>Parachutes:</b> two<br><b>Diameter:</b> 76mm<br><b>Length:</b> 1 meter<br></p></div>

<h3>Pegasus I Rocket</h3>
<p>Pegasus was Gallantz Aerospace's first rocket, and its goal was to develop manufacturing and design capability for Gallantz Aerospace. It has flown twice currently, with 2 flights planned before it is retired and replaced with the Pegasus II. It is controlled with 3d printed fins, and reaches and apogee of about 250 meters<br><b>Status:</b> in use<br><b>In service:</b> nov 2020-current <br><b>Motor:</b> Estes D12-7<br><b>Parachutes:</b> 1<br><b>Diameter:</b> 34mm<br><b>Length:</b> 1 meter<br></p></div>

<!--Pegasus II image-->
<h3>Pegasus II Rocket</h3>
<p>Pegasus II is being developed as a replacement to the current Pegasus rocket. It was developed with several design goals. One, to continue to further Gallantz Aerospace's science goals, and to two, explare places that GA has not yet been. It ks meant to be more reusable and sustainable than Pegasus one, while iproving performance. So, along with being much more sustainable, its goal is to reach one kilometer in altitude. <br><b>Status:</b> in development<br><b>In service:</b> n/a<br><b>Motor:</b> unknown<br><b>Parachutes:</b> unknown<br><b>Diameter:</b> unknown<br><b>Length:</b> unknown<br></p></div>
